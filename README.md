# MICROBIOME HEALTH INDEX EXPLORATORY STUDY

## OVERVIEW OF WORK:

- [x] read thorough 5 papers describing different approaches aiming to develop Microbiome Health Index
- [x] prepared full description of data used in studies (training datasets, validation datasets, age, BMI, sex, disease, country) and visualisation
- [x] developed a pipeline to download datasets that can be used to compare the performance of various health indices 
- [ ] set up a VM instance with a containerized environment containing all health indices for reproducible benchmarking
